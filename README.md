# Omar McAdam

Founder-operator building AI-native internet products.
Started from zero 3 years ago (no code skills); now shipping at 100x velocity across product, code, and distribution.
I turn unclear ideas into launched systems fast, then scale them with ruthless iteration.
Currently pushing fully agentic code systems where AI owns real engineering workflows.
Always building. Always shipping.

## What I am building

- AI-native products with tiny teams and aggressive shipping loops.
- Fully agentic dev systems (idea -> spec -> code -> deploy -> improve).
- Open, commercial software that compounds through OSS and distribution.
